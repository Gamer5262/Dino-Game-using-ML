# Dino Game using ML

The major objective behind working on this project was personal fitness. It works as a great workout routine while being very fun to play. As we can train the model based on our jumping and then control the dino with our own jump, jumping abilities are also trained. The basic game is made in PyGame and a machine learning model is trained to detect specific changes in the input video to make the dino jump at the exact moment we want it to by giving input of the model to the pygame. To start using this, just run the Python file Dino_Game.py. If a module not found error arises, use pip install, install cv2, numpy, joblib, and pygame.
